# METS-Sleep
Collection of what I've worked on for the METS Sleep project

I became a member of Dr. Heather Wheeler's lab at Loyola University Chicago at the beginning of the 2022 spring semester.

Since then I have been working with data from the Pan-UK Biobank to analyze the genetic contributions to chronotypes and sleeping patterns.

This repository highlights my work on this project.
